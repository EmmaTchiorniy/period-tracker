        The menstrual phase begins on the first day of your period. It's when
        the lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina if pregnancy hasnâ€™t
        occurred. Most people bleed for three to five days, but a period lasting
        only three days to as many as seven days is usually not a cause for
        worry.
